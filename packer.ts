/**
 * packer.ts
 *
 * Accumulates nodes into chunks within min/max token budgets.
 *
 * Applies look-ahead merge for small nodes.
 * Flushes when near maxTokens.
 *
 * Packing algorithm:
 * 1. Initialize empty buffer and token count
 * 2. For each node:
 *    - If adding would exceed maxTokens, flush buffer
 *    - If buffer is below minTokens, try look-ahead merge
 *    - Add node to buffer and update token count
 * 3. Flush remaining buffer
 *
 * Look-ahead logic:
 * - If current chunk is small (< minTokens)
 * - Check if next node can fit without exceeding maxTokens
 * - Merge if possible to avoid tiny chunks
 *
 * Ensures all chunks (except possibly the last) meet minTokens requirement.
