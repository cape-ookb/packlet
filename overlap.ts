/**
 * overlap.ts
 *
 * Adds trailing sentences from previous chunk.
 *
 * Configurable overlap size (typically 1-3 sentences).
 *
 * Overlap strategy:
 * - Extract last N sentences from previous chunk
 * - Prepend to current chunk text
 * - Update token count to reflect added text
 *
 * Benefits of sentence-based overlap:
 * - Preserves complete thoughts (vs token-based cutting)
 * - Headers naturally stay with their content
 * - Maintains semantic continuity for retrieval
 *
 * Implementation considerations:
 * - Use regex to detect sentence boundaries
 * - Handle edge cases (code blocks, lists, etc.)
 * - Skip overlap for first chunk
 * - Adjust token counts after adding overlap
