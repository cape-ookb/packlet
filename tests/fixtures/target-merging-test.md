# Target Merging Test

## Small Section A

This is a small section with just enough content to be above minTokens when alone, but significantly below target.

## Small Section B

Another section that is small individually but when combined with Section A would be much closer to our target token count.

## Small Section C

A third small section that should also be considered for merging to reach optimal chunk sizes.

## Larger Section D

This section contains substantially more content that should make it large enough to stand on its own. It includes multiple paragraphs and detailed explanations that would make combining it with other sections result in chunks that exceed our target size. This represents the type of content that should remain as its own chunk because it's already close to or at the target size and doesn't need to be merged with smaller adjacent sections.
