# Mixed Content Test Document

## Introduction

This is a heading section with moderate content.

This is a paragraph with substantial content that provides good testing material for the packing algorithm.

```javascript
function example() {
  console.log("This is a code block");
  return "with multiple lines";
}
```

- List item one with content
- List item two with more content
- List item three with additional content

## Another Section

Medium-sized paragraph with additional content for testing purposes.

Another paragraph that continues the pattern.

> This is a blockquote with some content for testing different node types in the packing algorithm.

### Finally

This is an extremely comprehensive and detailed paragraph containing extensive technical explanations, methodological approaches, implementation strategies, architectural considerations, performance optimizations, security measures, documentation standards, best practices, design patterns, development workflows, testing methodologies, deployment strategies, maintenance procedures, monitoring approaches, and various other complex technical concepts that significantly approach the established token limit threshold through exhaustive coverage of multiple technical domains and comprehensive analysis of implementation details.
