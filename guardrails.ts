/**
 * guardrails.ts
 *
 * Validates chunks: too short, formatting-only, orphaned code, empty headers.
 *
 * Development: throws on violations.
 * Production: logs + strips invalid chunks.
 *
 * Quality checks:
 * - Minimum length (e.g., 100 chars unless meaningful header)
 * - Not just formatting (---, ```, ###)
 * - Not orphaned code without context
 * - Not empty headers
 * - Not exceeding max token limit
 *
 * Modes:
 * - strictMode: Throw errors on violations (development)
 * - lenientMode: Log warnings and filter out bad chunks (production)
 *
 * Helps ensure:
 * - All chunks are meaningful for retrieval
 * - No wasted embeddings on low-quality content
 * - Consistent quality across the corpus
