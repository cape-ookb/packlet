/**
 * guardrails.ts
 *
 * Validates chunks: too short, formatting-only, orphaned code, empty headers.
 *
 * Development: throws on violations.
 * Production: logs + strips invalid chunks.
 *
 * Quality checks:
 * - Minimum length (e.g., 100 chars or ~200 tokens unless meaningful header/title)
 * - Absolute minimum of 64 tokens.
 * - Not just formatting (---, ```, ###)
 * - Not orphaned code without context (< 200 chars prose nearby)
 * - Not empty headers
 * - Not exceeding max token limit
 * - Not whitespace-only or empty string
 *
 * Modes:
 * - strictMode: Throw errors on violations (development)
 * - lenientMode: Log warnings and filter out bad chunks (production)
 *
 * Metadata:
 * - Each violation should include a reason code (e.g., "TOO_SHORT", "ORPHANED_CODE")
 * - Can be attached to logs or monitoring for analysis
 *
 * Helps ensure:
 * - All chunks are meaningful for retrieval
 * - No wasted embeddings on low-quality content
 * - Consistent quality across the corpus
 * - Clear visibility into common failure cases for tuning
