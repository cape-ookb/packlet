# Chunker Refactor Task List

This document outlines the comprehensive refactor needed to align the current implementation with the new ... specification defined in `x.md` and `y.md`.

## Dev Process

- Work on one task at a time.
- **IMPORTANT: Once complete, check off tasks in any and all docs by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.**
- **ALWAYS mark tasks as complete immediately after finishing them - don't batch multiple completions.**
- Ask before continuing onto the next task.

## Task Completion Instructions

**Before marking a task complete:**
1. Verify the functionality works as specified
2. Run relevant tests to ensure nothing breaks
3. Check that the implementation matches the requirements in the referenced documentation
4. Update this file by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for completed tasks

**When marking tasks complete:**
- Mark individual sub-tasks as `[x]` when done
- Mark the parent task/section as complete only when ALL sub-tasks are done
- Be specific - if only part of a task is done, only mark that specific part
- If you discover a task needs to be split into smaller parts, update the task list accordingly
