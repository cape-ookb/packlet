/**
 * normalize.ts
 *
 * Cleans up whitespace and formatting while preserving structure.
 *
 * - Dedents code blocks
 * - Collapses blank lines
 * - Preserves fenced code blocks intact
 *
 * Normalization rules:
 * - Trim leading/trailing whitespace
 * - Collapse multiple blank lines to single blank line
 * - Preserve intentional formatting in code blocks
 * - Standardize line endings (\n)
 * - Remove trailing spaces from lines
 *
 * Special handling for code:
 * - Detect minimum indentation level
 * - Remove common indentation while preserving relative indents
 * - Keep fenced code blocks exactly as authored
 * - Preserve inline code formatting
